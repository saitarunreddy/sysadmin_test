## Question 1
The nmap tool can be used to find out about all the open ports in a system or in a network. Using nmap with `-A` option gives us information about the operating system a particular computer in the network.
Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, device types, and MAC addresses.

### The command `nmap -A 14.139.34.*` can be used to find out all the PCs in the network, their open ports and what kind of operating system they are running on.
